## Getting started

You will need Node.js and npm installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ymk-coder-star/code-canvas.git
cd code-canvas
npm install
npm start
```

The development server runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Available scripts

- `npm start` — start the development server
- `npm run build` — create an optimized production build
- `npm test` — start the Create React App test runner
- `npm run optimize-images` — convert source images to optimized WebP assets
- `npm run generate-favicon` — generate favicon files from the monogram artwork
- `npm run inject-meta` — inject values from `src/constants/site.js` into the HTML metadata template

When updating the site’s title, description, URL, social preview, or CV path, edit `src/constants/site.js` and run `npm run inject-meta`.

## Routes

- `/` — Code Canvas home (services, selected work, approach, contact)
- `/portfolio` — full project galleries
- `/about` — profile, background, tech stack, and contact details
- `/portfolio/projects/:projectId` — project case study

## Project structure

```
code-canvas/
public/                 Static files, social preview, favicons, and CV
scripts/                Image, favicon, and metadata utilities
src/
  assets/               Project images, profile photo, and brand artwork
  components/           Shared layout, UI, and icon components
  constants/            Site-wide metadata and contact details
  data/                 Projects, case studies, services, skills, and tech stack
  hooks/                Custom React hooks
  pages/                Home, Portfolio, About, and Case Study pages
  utils/                Shared helper functions
```

Project, case study, and service content lives in `src/data`, so new work can be added without changing page layouts.

## Deployment

Configured for Vercel. `vercel.json` rewrites application routes to `index.html` so React Router URLs work when opened directly.
